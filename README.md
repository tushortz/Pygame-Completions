**Note**: It is advisable to disable all other python completions when using this package or disable this package when working on python files that doesnt require pygame. This gives you a cleaner interface but it is not necessary.

## Installation
> Important: You need to have `Package Control` installed first on your sublime text which can be found at [The Package Contol Website](http://packagecontrol.io)

### Using Package Control's Repository

Go to `Preferences` --> `Package Control` --> `Install package` --> then type into the textbox `Pygame Completions`

The package will be installed and ready for use.


### Using Git

Locate your Sublime Text `Packages` directory by using the menu item `Preferences -> Browse Packages...`.

While inside the `Packages` directory, clone the theme repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/tushortz/Pygame-Completions

or just download the zipped folder, extract it and paste the extracted folder into your sublime text packages directory.
